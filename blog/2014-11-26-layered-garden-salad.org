| 1 10-oz pkg | frozen green peas                                      |
| 1 cup       | sour cream                                             |
| 1 cup       | mayonnaise                                             |
| 1 to 2 tbsp | sugar                                                  |
| 1 lb.       | bacon, cooked and crumbled                             |
| 1 cup       | grated Swiss cheese                                    |

** Procedure

Layer the lettuce, spinach, broccoli, and peas in a 3 quart glass
bowl or rectangular pan.  I always use one of the disposable aluminum
pans that you can get from the grocery store.  Get the ones that come
with a snap-on plastic lid.

Mix sour cream and mayonnaise well and spread evenly over the
top, sealing to the edge.  Sprinkle evenly with sugar, then bacon,
then cheese.

Cover the container tightly and refrigerate at least 2 hours to allow
the flavors to blend.  I alway try and make it a day ahead of time.
