After seeing with my own eyes how rapidly the very minimal the [[http://xmonad.org/][xmonad
windowing manager]] starts up after logging in, I decided to upgrade an
old Linux box I have at the office that is running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
(Trusy Tahr).

** David Brewer's Easy Installation

David Brewer's [[https://github.com/davidbrewer/xmonad-ubuntu-conf][xmonad-ubuntu-conf]] is really well-documented and it is
what my buddy at work based his setup on.  I started by forking
David's repository so that I could maintain serveral branches online
(one for each Linux box I install xmonad on).

After that, you just clone the repository out to ~$HOME/.xmonad~ and
run this command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
~/.xmonad/install-xmonad
#+END_SRC

** Keyboard Tweaks

I'm using a really nice and solid [[http://www.pckeyboard.com/][IBM Model M Keyboard]] for my Linux
box.  It has no /Super/ key and you /really/ need one with xmonad.

I wanted to remap my /Alt/ key on the right-hand side of the spacebar
as the /Super/ key.  I found instructions [[http://askubuntu.com/questions/70931/how-to-set-right-alt-to-work-as-a-winsuper-key][here]]:

Basically just edit ~$HOME/.Xmodmap~ (you may not already have this
file) and add the following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
! Free up Right-Alt for remapping
remove mod1 = Alt_R

! Remap Right-Alt to Super
clear mod4
keycode 108 = Super_R
add mod4 = Super_R
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then just log out and back in again.

** Desktop Backgrounds

This involves two steps.  The first it to select and save them, the
second is restore when you log in.  The /nitrogen/ command is used to
do both.

*** Selecting and Saving

Start /nitrogen/ as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nitrogen --save <path-to-pictures-directory>
#+END_SRC

Select the picture or pictures (if you have multiple desktops) that
you want.  Then exit the program.

*** Restoring Desktop when you Log in

Edit the file ~$HOME/.xinitrc~ (it may not already exist).

Add the following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
nitrogen --restore &
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Fixing the stalonetray with Dual Monitors

The /stalonetray/ goes in the upper-right corner of the window.  On my
machine, with dual monitors, all my menu-bar stuff /except/ for that
was on the left monitor.  The /stalonetray/ was at the upper-right
corner of the right monitor and there was a little gray box in the
upper-right corner if the left monitor where it should have been.

Fixing this is easy.  First, determine the number of x-pixels in your
monitors.  I found this out by running the /Displays/ app.  My
monitors are ~1680x1050~.

Now edit the file ~$HOME/.xmonad/start-xmonad~.  Search for
"stalonetray".  Edit the ~--geometry~ setting.  

Mine ~--geometry~ setting had this value originally:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
--geometry 5x1-0+0
#+END_EXAMPLE

I changed it to ths:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
--geometry 5x1-1680+0
#+END_EXAMPLE

Restart /xmonad/ and you are good to go.
