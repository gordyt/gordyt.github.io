    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>OK, this post is part of my continuing experiments with an ASUS C200
Chromebook.  I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 using <em>crouton</em>.</p>
<p>I had created two partitions on a Micro SD Card, one as Fat32 (EsFat
actually) and the other as ext4.</p>
<p>The FAT32 partition mounts at <code>/media/removeable/share</code> and the ext4
partition mounts at <code>/media/removeable/gordy</code>.  I tried storing
various projects on the ext4 partition but when I tried to build from
that partition I would get a permissions error.</p>
<p>Long story short, it turns out that the the ChromeOS side is mounting
the ext4 partition with <em>noexec</em> permissions.  That was causing all
the problems.  The solution turned out to be simple.  Just a single
command to remount the partition (issued from the Ubuntu side) does
the trick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo mount -t ext4 -o remount,rw /dev/mmcblk1p1 /var/host/media/removable/gordy
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So, in the above command:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-t ext4</code> is the type of the partition.  I had previously formatted
it as ext4.</li>
<li><code>-o remount,rw</code> tells the system to remote the partition with
read/write privileges</li>
<li><code>/dev/mmcblk1p1</code> is the path to the partition that needs to be
mounted.  It will likely be different on your machine.  You can find
out what your device path is by just typing <code>mount</code> with no
arguments and grepping for the name of the volume.</li>
<li><code>/var/host/media/removable/gordy</code> is the mount point.  A careful
reader will notice that this is different than what I wrote at the
top of the post (<code>/media/removeable/gordy</code>).  Well as it turns out
<code>/media/removeable</code> is a symbolic link to
<code>/var/host/media/removeable</code> and if you try to mount to
<code>/media/removeable/gordy</code> the mount command complains about trying
to follow too many symbolic links.  Please note that this mount path
will also be different on you machine, unless you named your
partition &ldquo;gordy&rdquo; as well. :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, after remounting I am able to use my ext4 partition to hold
projects and be able to <code>./configure</code> and <code>make</code> out of directories on
the partition just fine.</p><ul class="pa0">
