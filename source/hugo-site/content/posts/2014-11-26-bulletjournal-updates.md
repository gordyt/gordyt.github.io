I have been using Ryder Carroll's [BulletJournal](http://www.bulletjournal.com) techniques for
organizing my analog journal for about 6 months now.  There are
several things I really like about this system.

-   It is easy to maintain
-   It lets you carry around just _one_ paper journal that you can use
    for everything; e.g., to-do lists, project notes, work and activity
    tracking, study notes, etc.
-   It is very easy to customize to fit your needs.

Regarding that last point, I would like to share my current setup.
