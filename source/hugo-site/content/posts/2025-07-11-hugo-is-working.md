I have finally gotten around to resurrecting my old test blog
`blog.gordontillman.info`. I was originally using `org-octopress`
which I like.  But after it was no longer supported/available I just
quit maintaining this blog.

As of today it is now a Hugo blog, currently using the `ananke` theme.
Checkout the `source` branch of [this repo](https://github.com/gordyt/gordyt.github.io) for details.
