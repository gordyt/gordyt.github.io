My buddy at work just got a new Acer C720-3404 Chromebook.  I have the
ASUS C200MA-EDU-4GB Chromebook.  We decided to do a real-world
performance comparison with a sample task that we have to perform all
of the time.

This task was compiling a program.  We choose to compile Emacs 24.4.
Here are the results.


| *Task*      | *Acer C720*            | *ASUS C200*             |
|-------------+------------------------+-------------------------|
| ./configure | 37.1 seconds           | 1 minute, 7.4 seconds   |
| make        | 3 minutes, 2.2 seconds | 5 minutes, 44.3 seconds |


As you can see, the Acer C720 with its /1.7 GHz Core i3/ processor 
was much faster than the ASUS with its /2.16 GHz Celeron/ processor.
