I have been using Ryder Carroll's [[http://www.bulletjournal.com][BulletJournal]] techniques for
organizing my analog journal for about 6 months now.  There are
several things I really like about this system.

- It is easy to maintain
- It lets you carry around just /one/ paper journal that you can use
  for everything; e.g., to-do lists, project notes, work and activity
  tracking, study notes, etc.
- It is very easy to customize to fit your needs.

Regarding that last point, I would like to share my current setup.
