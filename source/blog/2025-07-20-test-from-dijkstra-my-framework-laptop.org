Decided to test out setting up and enabling this wiki setup on my
Fedora Linux laptop that I got from the good folks at [[https://frame.work/][Frame.Work]]. Have
had it for a while now.  I got the smaller laptop, the Framework
Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 7040 Series).

It it light and handy.  Has a decent keyboard for a laptop. Running
the latest version of Fedora, as of the time of this post:

#+begin_src shell
  cat /etc/fedora-release 
  Fedora release 42 (Adams)
#+end_src

It's a solid distro and is kept very up-to-date, which I like.
