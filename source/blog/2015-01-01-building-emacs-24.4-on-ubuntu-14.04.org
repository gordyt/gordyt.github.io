I recently signed up for a Virtual Private Server (VPS) with [[https://vpsdime.com][vpsdime]].
The idea is to set-up a complete development environment for all of my
work and personal projects that I can access from a low-end device
like a [[https://www.google.com/chrome/devices/][Chromebook]] or an [[https://www.apple.com/ipad/][iPad]] (with a suitable SSH app installed).

I opted for the /High RAM VPS/, which has the following
specifications:

- 6 GB RAM
- 4 CPUs
- 30GB Storage
- 2TB/month traffic
- 10 Gb connection

It is very reasonably priced at only $7.00/month.  I had it spun up
with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

My first requirements were installing [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs 24.4]] 24.3 is the only
version available in the repositories and I found no [[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bppas][Personal Package
Archive (PPA)]] that already supplied it. The remainder of this post
documents the steps required to do this.

** Dependencies

There are a few things you need to have installed before you can build
Emacs.  You need to update your list of [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine][repository sources]] first.

Edit the file ~/etc/apt/sources.list~ as root.  On a new Ubuntu 14.04 instance
it looks like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty main restricted universe
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-updates main restricted universe
deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-security main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu trusty partner
#+END_EXAMPLE

You need to enable the source code repositories.  This is very simple
to do.  Just duplicate the first four lines in the file and change
~deb~ at the beginning of the line to ~deb-src~.  When you have done
this the file will look like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty main restricted universe
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-updates main restricted universe
deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-security main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu trusty partner
deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty main restricted universe
deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-updates main restricted universe
deb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-security main restricted universe multiverse
deb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu trusty partner
#+END_EXAMPLE

Save your changes and then run the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get update
#+END_SRC

Now you can install the dependencies that you will need:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get build-dep emacs24
#+END_SRC

** Building Emacs 24.4

I like to organize my projects in a directory hierarchy like this:

- ~$HOME/Projects/~
  - ~0-9/~
  - ~a/~
  - ~b/~
  - ...
  - ~z/~

So, my Emacs build would be located in the ~$HOME/Projects/e~
directory.  Please feel free to ignore the above.  It is just a
personal preference.  With that out of the way, here we go...

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir -p $HOME/Projects/e
cd $HOME/Projects/e
wget ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/emacs-24.4.tar.xz
tar -xf emacs-24.4.tar.xz
rm emacs-24.4.tar.xz
cd emacs-24.4
./configure
make
sudo make install
#+END_SRC

That's all there is to it!
