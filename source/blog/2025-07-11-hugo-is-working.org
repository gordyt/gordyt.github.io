I have finally gotten around to resurrecting my old test blog
~blog.gordontillman.info~. I was originally using ~org-octopress~
which I like.  But after it was no longer supported/available I just
quit maintaining this blog.

As of today it is now a Hugo blog, currently using the ~ananke~ theme.
Checkout the ~source~ branch of [[https://github.com/gordyt/gordyt.github.io][this repo]] for details.
