This is just a simple _test post_ to see if I have the basic
[Octopress](http://octopress.org) configuration done correctly.  I
tried also getting
[org-octopress](https://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress)
configured at the same time but I am getting an error when I evaluate
the `org-octopress` command, so I will get to that later.
