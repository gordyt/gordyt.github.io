My buddy at work just got a new Acer C720-3404 Chromebook.  I have the
ASUS C200MA-EDU-4GB Chromebook.  We decided to do a real-world
performance comparison with a sample task that we have to perform all
of the time.

<p>
This task was compiling a program.  We choose to compile Emacs 24.4.
Here are the results.

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">

<col  class="left" />

<th scope="col" class="left"><b>Acer C720</b></th>
<th scope="col" class="left"><b>ASUS C200</b></th>

<td class="left">./configure</td>
<td class="left">37.1 seconds</td>
<td class="left">1 minute, 7.4 seconds</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left">make</td>
<td class="left">3 minutes, 2.2 seconds</td>
<td class="left">5 minutes, 44.3 seconds</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>
As you can see, the Acer C720 with its <i>1.7 GHz Core i3</i> processor 
was much faster than the ASUS with its <i>2.16 GHz Celeron</i> processor.
