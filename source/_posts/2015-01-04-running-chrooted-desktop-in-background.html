I made a post yesterday that covered the steps required to install
Ubuntu on an ASUS C200 Chromebook.  One thing I noticed was that,
while you are running Ubuntu, it ties up your terminal window and
makes it unavailable for doing other tasks.

According to some information that <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">I found here</a>, you should be able to
accomplish this via a parameter supplied to the <code>startxfce4</code> command.
For example:
</p>

<pre class="example">
startxfce4 -b
</pre>

<p>
That didn't seem to work for me.  The command still ran in the foreground.
I found that just using the standard Unix/Linux way worked fine:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">startxfce4 &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<i>Note:</i>  You cannot prefix this with <code>nohup</code> and close out the
terminal completely.  Doing so will exit the chroot environment and
terminate Ubuntu.  But at least you know have access to the
command-line in that terminal and you don't have to look at a bunch of
debug messages.
