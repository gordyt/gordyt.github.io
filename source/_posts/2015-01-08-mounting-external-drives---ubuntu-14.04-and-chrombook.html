OK, this post is part of my continuing experiments with an ASUS C200
Chromebook.  I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 using <i>crouton</i>.
</p>

<p>
I had created two partitions on a Micro SD Card, one as Fat32 (EsFat
actually) and the other as ext4.  
</p>

<p>
The FAT32 partition mounts at <code>/media/removeable/share</code> and the ext4
partition mounts at <code>/media/removeable/gordy</code>.  I tried storing
various projects on the ext4 partition but when I tried to build from
that partition I would get a permissions error.

<p>
Long story short, it turns out that the the ChromeOS side is mounting
the ext4 partition with <i>noexec</i> permissions.  That was causing all
the problems.  The solution turned out to be simple.  Just a single
command to remount the partition (issued from the Ubuntu side) does
the trick:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">sudo mount -t ext4 -o remount,rw /dev/mmcblk1p1 /var/host/media/removable/gordy
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So, in the above command:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>-t ext4</code> is the type of the partition.  I had previously formatted
it as ext4.
</li>
<li><code>-o remount,rw</code> tells the system to remote the partition with
read/write privileges
</li>
<li><code>/dev/mmcblk1p1</code> is the path to the partition that needs to be
mounted.  It will likely be different on your machine.  You can find
out what your device path is by just typing <code>mount</code> with no
arguments and grepping for the name of the volume.
</li>
<li><code>/var/host/media/removable/gordy</code> is the mount point.  A careful
reader will notice that this is different than what I wrote at the
top of the post (<code>/media/removeable/gordy</code>).  Well as it turns out
<code>/media/removeable</code> is a symbolic link to
<code>/var/host/media/removeable</code> and if you try to mount to
<code>/media/removeable/gordy</code> the mount command complains about trying
to follow too many symbolic links.  Please note that this mount path
will also be different on you machine, unless you named your
partition "gordy" as well. :-)
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Anyway, after remounting I am able to use my ext4 partition to hold
projects and be able to <code>./configure</code> and <code>make</code> out of directories on
the partition just fine.
